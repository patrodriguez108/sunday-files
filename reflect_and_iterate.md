4 rules of design:
- Passes the tests
- Reveals intention
- No duplication
- Fewest elements

Pig Latin

Sam
  - Something I learned: how to check for matches between the index of a string as well as a selection of characters without having the characters be elements in an array and iterating through the array *shreik*
  - Something did well: overall I find the whole thing solid; of particular note is checking for matches of string[0] to the vowels and doing the same thing with the string array and consonants, because I really wouldn't have been able to write that without seeing his file first
  - Something that could be in line with 4 rules: while it is well-executed and it functions very well, I do believe that he could have been more in line with the four rules with the consonants search

Charlie
  - Something I learned: how to implement ennumerable methods to a sentence
  - Something did well: moving beginning character to the end of the word and adding "ay"
  - Something that could have been more in line with the 4 rules: he doesn't pass the test of moving all beginning consonants to the end of the sentence

Baska
  - Something I learned: that there is a lot more syntax in Ruby that I still don't know; there's a lot going on in this file that I don't understand
  - Something did well: well it looks like she knows what she's doing
  - Something that could have been more in line with the 4 rules: I'll get back to you on this one

Questions
- Reviewing cohortmats codes really opened up a lot of doors for me. They all performed the methods very differently. Sam performed the function in a more complex way than I would have done, but I understood it. Charlie's code was much cleaner and closer to my style, but he still didn't move all beginning consonants. I'll need to talk to Baska and ask her what her code means. But once I started writing out my code, I will admit I did mimic much of Charlie's code but the fun came in on working on how to move all beginning consonants.
- Mostly I want to understand much of the syntax that is foreign to me. When I see these characters that are related to Rubular, which I still don't even understand, I feel a bit lost.
- The only dead end I found was trying to capitalize the first letter of the sentence.
